## Background

For this challenge, we were tasked with selecting any data we preferred from [Citi Bike](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) to perform data analysis for city officials who might be curious about a specific topic.

My topic: How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted Citi Bike usage?

Questions:
1. Are there more bikes pre-COVID or during COVID in use?
2. Has there been a difference in genders using the bikes pre-pandemic and during?
3. What were the busiest use times for bikes and did it differ pre-COVID to quarantine?
4. What bike stations were popular before the pandemic and during?  Were there any trends?
5. Were there any surprises in the data?  Any watchouts from a bias concern?

Learnings:
For the most part, upon reviewing the data, there does appear to be logic in the results.  There was variability in the times that were busy likely due to less commuting with work from home lifestyle shift.
A couple of surprises in the data were that there were more bikes in use in 2020 despite quarantine and less commuting to an office.  Perhaps because people wanted to get outdoors for activity and fresh air.  This could also explain why the mapping of the data shows a shift in the frequency more towards the water/scenic areas for bike use.
